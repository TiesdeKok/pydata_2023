This is a typical occurrence, but it is a significant problem in performance-critical Machine Learning systems. Today's data is changing and evolving at a breakneck speed. It's critical to keep up with shifting data if you require high-performance models. As a result, it's critical to spot the point in production where your data diverges from the one it was trained on.

However, the challenge is that pandas is not meant for big data processing. This presents data practitioners a dilemma: should we downsample data and lose information? Or should we explore a distributed processing framework to scale out data workloads? An example of a mainstream distributed processing tool is Apache Spark. However, this means data practitioners now have to learn a new language, PySpark. Not all is bleak though: pandas API on Spark provides pandas equivalent APIs in PySpark. It allows pandas users to transition from single-node to distributed environment, by just simply swapping the pandas package with pyspark.pandas. On the other hand, existing PySpark users may wish to write their own custom user-defined functions (UDFs) that are not included in existing PySpark API. Pandas Function APIs, newly included in Spark 3.0+, allow users to apply arbitrary Python native functions, with pandas instances as the input and output against a PySpark dataframe. For instance, data scientists could use pandas function API to train a ML model based on each group of data using a single line of code. Co-presented by both a top open-source Apache Spark commiter and a hands-on data science consultant, this talk equips data analysts and scientists with the knowledge of scaling their data analysis workloads with implementation details and best practice guidance.

There's often some Python shepherding the the underlying tools (often CLI tools) 2. _ML Models_ large language models are getting very good generally, e.g. Codex. Similar models are making nacent progress in Biology, e.g. ESM by meta 3. _Munging_ the lovely tasks that're relevant to every field, but how to do it is normally tacit within the field. The same is true for Bioinformatics.",

There are some methods that have emerged as clear favourites and are widely used in industry to get a sense of understanding of complex models. However, they are not perfect and often mislead practitioners with a false sense of security. In this talk, we look at the popular methods and illustrate when they fail, how they fail and why they fail.",

Rust offers an alternative to C/C++ with these benefits: * As fast as C/C++ * Much better memory safety and security than C/C++ * Most loved programming language since 2016 * Multithreading without needing a runtime In this talk, we\u2019ll cover nine rules that I learned as I ported our open-source genomics extension from C++ to Rust. This will help you get started and help you organize your project. If you\u2019re a seasoned extension writer frustrated with C/C++, or a beginner looking to write your first extension, this talk is for you!",

It frequently involves iterating over multiple models on a smaller scale and then converting those models to run at scale. In this talk we will discuss the inefficiencies of this process and present a modern open source based solution that helps to mitigate many of these inefficiencies. The proposed tools and approaches help data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers work more efficiently across all ranges of tasks and reduce the time-to-solution. We also present future development plans.",

With its ability to handle big data at scale, Sedona has the potential to transform industries. In this presentation, we will delve into the key features of Apache Sedona and showcase its powerful capabilities in handling large-scale spatial data. Additionally, we will highlight the recent developments in Apache Sedona and how they have further enhanced the system's performance and scalability. We will also showcase examples of how Sedona has been used in various industries such as transportation, logistics, and geolocation-based services, to gain insights and improve decision-making.",

LLMs have gained immense popularity in recent months and require scalable solutions to overcome challenges they present in terms of data ingestion, training, fine-tuning, batch (offline) inference, and online serving. However, LLM-type workloads share some common challenges with other types of large scale ML use cases. Let\u2019s explore the current state of Generative AI and LLMs and have a closer look at the emerging (yet still early) open source tech stack for this workload. Then we will evaluate how Ray AI Runtime provides a scalable compute substrate, addressing orchestration and scalability problems. Finally, we will demonstrate how you can implement distributed fine-tuning and batch (offline) inference with HuggingFace and Ray AI Runtime, using recent Google\u2019s Flan-T5 model and Alpaca dataset.",
